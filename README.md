Ruby : rspec sample
==================

Simple example for rspec test (Ruby application).

This sample is based on [this tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby-for-newbies-testing-with-rspec--net-21297). I have "adapted" it for the latest version of rspec (Some methods like 'should' are now depreciated).
