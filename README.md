Ruby : rspec sample
==================

Simple example for rspec test (Ruby application).

This sample is based on [this tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby-for-newbies-testing-with-rspec--net-21297). I have "adapted" it for the latest version of rspec (Some methods like 'should' are now depreciated).

## How it works

* Clone this repository
* Install the library with bundle
* Launch test

concretly

```
cd your/path/here

#clone repository
git clone https://github.com/canujohann/ruby-rspec-example.git
cd  ruby-rspec-example

#don't forget to install bundler if needed ! (http://bundler.io/)
bundle install

#launch test (parameter is the name of the folder)
rspec spec
```

You're done !
